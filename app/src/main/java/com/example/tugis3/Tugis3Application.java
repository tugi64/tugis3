 This Java file previously defined Tugis3Application and caused a duplicate-class
 error because the Kotlin implementation exists at

 Keep this file as a harmless placeholder to avoid accidental duplicate-class
 issues. If you prefer, you can delete this file entirely once the repo is
 committed/merged.
