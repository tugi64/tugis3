The interface differs in the coordinate system parameter type when a project is created: 
•	Local parameters 
•	RTCM1021~1027 parameters: a way to send coordinate system parameter via differential data. In this way, the software analyses coordinate parameters from received differential data. 
The Coordinate Systems Parameters interface is unchangeable. 
•	CORS encrypted parameters: it is mainly used by CORS merchants when they would like to keep coordinate parameters secret. 
The Coordinate Systems Parameters interface is unchangeable. 
Taking parameter type local parameters as an example, the interface is as follows: 
  
Set Coordinate Parameters 
To set coordinate parameters, do the following: 
1.	Set a name for the coordinate system. 
2.	Set the following parameters according to the actual situation: 
o	Ellipsoid parameter: to select the target ellipsoid or customize the ellipsoid. With the customized ellipsoid, please set the semimajor axis and reciprocal of flattening 1/f, which should be the same with the ellipsoid used for parameter calculation. o Projection parameter: it contains most of the frequently-used projection modes, such as UTM, Gauss Kruger, Transverse Mercator, Lambert Conic Conformal, etc. 
During setting projection parameters, when the central meridian is not the 
same with the actual situation, you can press   or manually input the current central meridian. 
o	ITRF parameter: ITRF refers to International Terrestrial Reference Frame. o Seven parameter: to perform Space rectangular coordinate transformation within two different ellipsoids. 
o	Four-parameter/horizontal adjustment: in general at least two known points and four pairs of XY coordinate values in two different space rectangular coordinate systems are required to calculate the four unknown parameters. o Vertical control parameter: to use some known points to calculate the vertical control parameters, in order to match the elevation of receivers with the local height system. 
o	Vertical adjustment parameter: the elevation transformation model of Trimble TGO software. o Grid file: to match the horizontal difference (North and East) between the local and universal coordinate system, and import the grid file (*.GDS, *.GSB, *.GFS). o Geoid file: to match the earth height (ellipsoid height used in GPS elevation system) with the normal height (used in elevation system in survey), and import the geoid file (*.GGF, *.SGF, *.UGF, *.GSF). o Local offsets: to calculate local offsets based on a known point. 
Use Existing Coordinate Parameters 
It is used to apply coordinate system parameters stored before. 
To use existing coordinate parameters, do the following: 
1.	Press Use existing. 
2.	Select one of the following methods to apply coordinate parameters: 
o	Local disk: to apply them in the local. SP and EP formats are supported. o QR code: to apply them by scanning the QR code. 
o	Cloud server: to apply them from the cloud server. 
See 3.8 Cloud Settings for details. 
o	Predefined projections: to apply predefined parameters saved before. 
Export Coordinate Parameters

Calibrate a Point 
Press main menu Project → Calibrate Point to enter Calibrate Point interface: 
  
There are the following ways to calibrate a point: 
•	Base point calibration: the base station is set up at known control points and has been leveled and centered. 
  CAUTION: This function is rarely used in the measurement. 
•	Marker point calibration: the base station is not set up at a known control point when it has been turned on / off or its position has been changed, and the rover station is set up at known control points. 
Do Base Point Calibration 
By inputting coordinates of a known point and WGS84 coordinate automatically obtained when the base station is started, SurPad will calculate calibration parameters of the base station. 
To do base point calibration, do the following: 
1.	To enter Calibrate Point interface, press main menu Project → Calibrate Point, and press Base Point Calibration: 
  
2.	To input a known point, do one of the following:

•	Antenna measurement type o Height from phase center o Slant height form measuring line o Vertical height from measuring line o Slant height form altimetry o Vertical height 
•	Antenna height: the vertical height from the phase center of the antenna to the ground. 
Principle 
  
Among them: 
•	a: the vertical height form the bottom of the receiver to the ground. 
•	b: the vertical height from the bottom of the receiver to the phase center. 
•	c: the vertical height from the bottom of the receiver to the measuring line. 
•	b-c: the vertical height from the phrase center to the measuring line. 
•	d: the vertical height from the measuring line to the ground. 
•	h: the antenna height. 
•	s: the slant height form the measuring line to the ground. 
•	R: the radius of the rubber ring. 
•	S: the slant height from the altimetry piece to the ground with the known radius (Rc) of the alitimetry piece. 
There are the following ways to calculate the antenna height: 
Measured height 	antenna measurement type 	Antenna height 
h 	Height from phase center 	h = h 
s 	Slant height form measuring line 	h = sqrt (s2 - R2) + (b - c) 
d 	Vertical height from measuring line 	h = a + c + (b - c) = a + b 
S 	Slant height from altimetry 	h = sqrt (S2 - Rc2) + b 
a 	Vertical height 	h = a + b
